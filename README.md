# custom-SVG-logos-for-sale

## Description

This application allows the user to generate a custom SVG logo provided they know what text they would like, along with shape and hexidecimal color codes for the text and shape color using only the integrated terminal in vs code without any GUI. This project allowed me to become familiar with the use of node, the inquirer prompt and response command, template literals, jest package and the fs writefile function. This code also required the user to write tests to pass the npm run test check for shapes so I was able to become familiar with writing passing tests.

## Credits

I referenced many classroom activities to familiarize myself with the user of node, inquirer prompt/response, template literals and jest. The readme attached to the challenge demonstrated what a completed logo should look like so that was referenced as an example during testing of this application. I also utilized the web to look up hexidecimal codes as well as SVG documentation.
